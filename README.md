# Loika

Loika is an ecommerce/subscription-based application that aims to deliver the best quality food from local farmers at a fair price to the consumersâ€™ doorstep with ease and reliability. 

## How it works

The application is designed on the mobile phone to easily connect the customers and our service. It is designed to be appealing but also efficient.
The application helps the customers order products, manage deliveries, discover new offers and learn more about the origins of the food. Thus, the engagement of the application is crucial to the business, it is how we communicate and promote the products to our customers. 

## Inspiration
Loika took inspiration from increase in demand for local, responsibly sourced food in place of the processed food available at big box stores. The average consumer is more conscious about the ingredients on their plates and their origins. Another key factor was connecting the local farmer's to their communities. Many farmer's participate in farmer's markets because it allows them to sell their food at lower prices while still making more because the middle man has been cut out. The issue is many people do not have access to farmer's markets. This application looks to fill this hole and create a streamlined experience for all involved. We should always be looking to support local, small businesses over the Walmarts and Whole Foods of the world!
